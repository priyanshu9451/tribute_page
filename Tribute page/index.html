          <h2 class="cyan-gradient">Who was Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel</h2>
          <p>
            Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel <br>  31 October 1875– 15 December 1950,
                      commonly known as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel,[a] was an Indian independence nationalist
                      and barrister who served as the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India from 1947 to 1950.
                      He was a senior leader of the Indian National Congress,
                      who played a significant role in the country's struggle for independence and its political integration.
                      In India and elsewhere, he was often called Sardar, meaning "Chief" in Hindi, Urdu, Bengali and Persian.
                      He acted as the Home Minister during the political integration of India and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              After India was free from British rule, Sardar Patel worked hard to bring the entire country
                          together for a strong national integration. This is why he is called the ‘Iron Man of India’.
            </li>
            <li>
              He was the recipient of the Bharat Ratna Award in 1991.
                          As a national leader, he firmly believed in the power of unity.
                          It was this belief that helped him bring divided India together.
                          His birth anniversary is observed as ‘Rashtriya Ekta Divas’ or 
                          the ‘National Unity Day in India so that we never forget his message of strength in being united.
